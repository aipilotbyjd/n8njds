### **Project: "FlowForge" - An n8n-like Workflow Automation Tool**

The plan is broken down into six key phases, designed to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first and then build upon it to reach production readiness.

---

### **Phase 1: The Core Workflow Engine (MVP)**

**Goal:** Create the heart of the application: the ability to define and execute a simple, linear workflow of nodes. At this stage, the UI will be minimal, and workflows will be defined directly in code or a simple JSON structure.

*   **1.1. Node Architecture:**
    *   Define a base `Node` abstract class or interface in PHP (`app/Nodes/Node.php`).
    *   Each node must have an `execute(array $input): array` method. The output of one node will be the input for the next.
    *   Create 2-3 initial, simple nodes:
        *   **Manual Trigger Node:** A starting point for a workflow.
        *   **HTTP Request Node:** To make API calls to external services (using Laravel's HTTP Client).
        *   **Log Node:** A simple node to log its input data, useful for debugging.

*   **1.2. Workflow Executor Service:**
    *   Create a `WorkflowExecutor` service (`app/Services/WorkflowExecutor.php`).
    *   This service will take a workflow definition (e.g., an array of node configurations) and an initial input.
    *   It will iterate through the nodes, executing each one sequentially and passing the data along.

*   **1.3. Basic Routing:**
    *   Create a simple API endpoint in `routes/api.php` that accepts a webhook. This webhook will trigger a hardcoded workflow for testing purposes.

### **Phase 2: User Management & Authentication**

**Goal:** Allow users to sign up, log in, and have their own private resources.

*   **2.1. Scaffolding:**
    *   Install and configure **Laravel Jetstream** or **Laravel Breeze**. This will instantly provide robust, secure, and well-tested authentication, registration, and profile management.
    *   Recommendation: **Jetstream with API support** is ideal as it includes Laravel Sanctum for authenticating the frontend we will build later.

*   **2.2. API Authentication:**
    *   Configure **Laravel Sanctum** to provide token-based authentication for the API. This will be crucial for the frontend to securely communicate with the backend.

---

### **Phase 3: Persistence & Asynchronous Execution**

**Goal:** Save user-created workflows to the database and run them as background jobs for scalability and reliability.

*   **3.1. Database Schema:**
    *   Create Eloquent models and migrations for:
        *   `Workflow`: To store the workflow's name, its JSON definition, `user_id`, and an `is_active` flag.
        *   `WorkflowExecution`: To log every time a workflow runs, its status (`pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`), and the final output or error.

*   **3.2. Asynchronous Jobs:**
    *   Refactor the `WorkflowExecutor` to be a queued job using Laravel's Queue system.
    *   When a workflow is triggered (e.g., by a webhook), instead of running it synchronously, you will dispatch the `WorkflowExecutor` job to the queue.
    *   Configure a queue driver (like `redis` or `database`) for background processing. This is essential for production.

---

### **Phase 4: The Frontend - Visual Workflow Builder**

**Goal:** Create the signature drag-and-drop UI that makes the tool intuitive and powerful.

*   **4.1. Frontend Setup:**
    *   Use the existing `vite.config.js` to set up a modern JavaScript framework like **React** or **Vue.js**.
    *   Structure the frontend code within the `resources/js/` directory.

*   **4.2. API Endpoints:**
    *   Build a REST API in Laravel for the frontend to consume:
        *   `GET /api/workflows`
        *   `POST /api/workflows`
        *   `GET /api/workflows/{id}`
        *   `PUT /api/workflows/{id}`
        *   `DELETE /api/workflows/{id}`
        *   `GET /api/nodes/available` (to list all node types for the sidebar)

*   **4.3. Visual Canvas:**
    *   Integrate a dedicated library for building node-based UIs. This is critical and will save months of work.
    *   **Recommendation:** **React Flow** (if using React) or **Vue Flow** (if using Vue).
    *   Implement the core UI features:
        *   A canvas where nodes can be placed.
        *   A sidebar listing all available nodes.
        *   The ability to drag nodes onto the canvas.
        *   Functionality to draw connections between nodes.
        *   A configuration panel that appears when a node is selected, allowing the user to edit its parameters.

---

### **Phase 5: Monetization - Billing & Subscriptions**

**Goal:** Integrate a billing system to manage subscription plans and feature access.

*   **5.1. Billing Integration:**
    *   Integrate **Laravel Cashier** with a payment provider like **Stripe**. Cashier provides an expressive, fluent interface to manage subscriptions, invoices, and payment events.

*   **5.2. Plan Definition:**
    *   Define subscription plans (e.g., Free, Pro, Business).
    *   Create a middleware to check a user's subscription status and enforce limits based on their plan (e.g., number of workflows, number of executions per month, access to "premium" nodes).

*   **5.3. Billing Portal:**
    *   Leverage the Stripe Customer Portal (integrated via Cashier) to allow users to manage their subscription, view payment history, and update their payment method without you needing to build a custom UI.

---

### **Phase 6: Production Readiness & Deployment**

**Goal:** Ensure the application is secure, testable, and deployable.

*   **6.1. Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests (using PHPUnit) for each individual Node.
    *   Write feature tests to validate the API endpoints and the end-to-end workflow execution process.

*   **6.2. Advanced Features:**
    *   **Credentials Management:** Create an encrypted system for users to store API keys and other credentials needed for their nodes.
    *   **Error Handling & Retries:** Implement robust error handling in the `WorkflowExecutor` and leverage Laravel's job retry capabilities.
    *   **Versioning:** Add versioning for workflows so users can revert to previous versions.

*   **6.3. Deployment:**
    *   Containerize the application using **Docker**.
    *   Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automatically run tests and deploy the application.
    *   Use a service like **Laravel Forge** for easy server provisioning and deployment, or deploy the containerized application to a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean.
